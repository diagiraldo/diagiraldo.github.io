abstract = {Abstract Introduction Neuropsychological test scores are limited and standard outcomes may mask the heterogeneity of cognitive impairment. This article presents the calculation and evaluation of six composite scores that quantify domain-specific impairment. Methods Parameters for composite scores calculation were learned by performing confirmatory factor analysis in a sample of participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. The obtained scores were evaluated with a separate sample of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in two automated tasks: unsupervised partition in different subgroups and prediction of progression to dementia for different time windows. Results MCI subgroups with distinctive cognitive profiles and risk of progression emerged from cluster analysis. Composite scores outperform standard neuropsychological tests when automatically predicting progression within time windows up to 5 years. Conclusions Domain-specific composite scores are useful to delineate profiles of impairment, stratify the MCI risk, and predict progression to dementia.},

abstract = {Background. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with altered white matter organization and impaired cognitive functioning. Objective. We aimed to investigate changes in white matter and cognitive functioning following computerized cognitive training. Methods. Sixteen adolescents with moderate-to-severe TBI (age 15.6 ± 1.8 years, 1.2-4.6 years postinjury) completed the 8-week BrainGames program and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and cognitive assessment at time point 1 (before training) and time point 2 (after training). Sixteen healthy controls (HC) (age 15.6 ± 1.8 years) completed DWI assessment at time point 1 and cognitive assessment at time point 1 and 2. Fixel-based analyses were used to examine fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and fiber cross-section (FC) on a whole brain level and in tracts of interest. Results. Patients with TBI showed cognitive impairments and extensive areas with decreased FA and increased MD together with an increase in FC in the body of the corpus callosum and left superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) at time point 1. Patients improved significantly on the inhibition measure at time point 2, whereas the HC group remained unchanged. No training-induced changes were observed on the group level in diffusion metrics. Exploratory correlations were found between improvements on verbal working memory and reduced MD of the left SLF and between increased performance on an information processing speed task and increased FA of the right precentral gyrus. Conclusions. Results are indicative of positive effects of BrainGames on cognitive functioning and provide preliminary evidence for neuroplasticity associated with cognitive improvements following cognitive intervention in TBI.}

abstract = {Abstract Purpose This work presents an automatic characterization of the Alzheimer's disease describing the illness as a multidirectional departure from a baseline defining the control state, being these directions determined by a distance between functional-equivalent anatomical regions. Methods After a brain parcellation, a region is described by its histogram of gray levels, and the Earth mover's distance establishes how close or far these regions are. The medoid of the control group is set as the reference and any brain is characterized by its set of distances to this medoid. Evaluation This hypothesis was assessed by separating groups of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment from control subjects, using a subset of the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database. An additional experiment evaluated the method generalization and consisted in training with the OASIS data and testing with the Minimal Interval Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer's disease (MIRIAD) database. Results Classification between controls and patients with AD resulted in an equal error rate of 0.1 (90\% of sensitivity and specificity at the same time). The automatic ranking of regions resulting is in strong agreement with those regions described as important in clinical practice. Classification with different databases results in a sensitivity of 85\% and a specificity of 91\%. Conclusions This method automatically finds out a multidimensional expression of the AD, which is directly related to the anatomical changes in specific areas such as the hippocampus, the amygdala, the planum temporale, and thalamus.},
